## Marek's suggestions 9-04-16

Look at images in hi-res
Make an ebook of images
Images of the author becoming a monster on the inside

Donate thing
Listen to album, watch video, download album

Don't like Tumblr
Likes Third Worlds a bit

Cursor is a gun and you shoot everything
Little mysteries and easter eggs

Idea: You go to a website and it's a black screen. But if you leave it open for an hour, then there's a light in the middle that slowly gets bigger and bigger and then you realize you are slowly exiting a tunnel and then something happens. 

Make the website like a virtual museum, an art gallery where every part of the experience is controlled and curated by the artist.

### Style

* Black backgrounds
* Fonts/Colors: not sure yet

### Galleries

* Moving gifs
* When viewing a picture, it should be either be:
  * Full screen so you have to press escape like in infranview slideshow
  * Or the biggest picture can be within the window like when you right 
  click view an image on google images (except black bg not white 
  or even gray)
 
### Navigation

* Different possible structures
  * Pictures, Drawings, Songs, Poems, Video
  * Or group by collections instead
  * Make it easy to support either one
* Store name: "Store" or "Showcase" or "Fair"
