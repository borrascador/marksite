## Marek's suggestions 9-04-16

Look at images in hi-res
Make an ebook of images
Images of the author becoming a monster on the inside

Donate thing
Listen to album, watch video, download album

Don't like Tumblr
Likes Third Worlds a bit

Cursor is a gun and you shoot everything
Little mysteries and easter eggs

Idea: You go to a website and it's a black screen. But if you leave it open for an hour, then there's a light in the middle that slowly gets bigger and bigger and then you realize you are slowly exiting a tunnel and then something happens. 

Make the website like a virtual museum, an art gallery where every part of the experience is controlled and curated by the artist.

### Style

* Black backgrounds

### Galleries

* Moving gifs
* When viewing a picture, it should be either be:
  * Full screen so you have to press escape like in infranview slideshow
  * Or the biggest picture can be within the window like when you right 
  click view an image on google images (except black bg not white 
  or even gray)
 
### Navigation

* Different possible structures
  * Pictures, Drawings, Songs, Poems, Video, Store

### Donation concepts

* Collection Plate - Good
* Wishing Well - Neutral
* Goblin - Bad

### Collection plate w/ candles

Dark page, on the bottom there is a gargoyle holding a plate
Plate has white text field where you enter amount to donate, then hit enter
And then a dim blue or red light appears floating in the air somewhere above the gargoyle. The lights are the candles arranged in a church on an iron grill. One by one blue and red candles go on for each individual donation, and they disappear at midnight.

### Concept of Phone as Magic Mirror

Phones deserve something great that remind you of the magic of technology - a donation app on the phone would perhaps serve a purpose, i.e. some money forwarded to a cause.
